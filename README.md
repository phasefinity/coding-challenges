## Find odd Int

Given an array with repeating integers, find the one integer, that only occurs an odd/uneven number of times. There will
always only be one integer with an odd number of occurrences.

#### Example:

Given `[4, 5, 4, 5, 5]`  
`4` occurs 2 times (even)  
`5` occurs 3 times (odd)  
-> You should return `5`
